The mockingbird in Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' signifies innocence and harmlessness. The text suggests that harming a mockingbird, a creature that only produces beautiful music, is equivalent to a sin. The narrative criticizes the act of injuring innocents through prejudicial and ignorant actions.
