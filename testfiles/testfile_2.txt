The title 'To Kill a Mockingbird' metaphorically represents the destruction of innocence. 
Throughout Lee's narrative, mockingbirds symbolize innocent beings harmed by societal injustices. 
This allegory critiques the ethical transgressions of harming those who, akin to mockingbirds, 
contribute positively to society without causing harm.
