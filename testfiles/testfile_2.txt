The novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee uses the mockingbird to represent purity and innocence. Killing a mockingbird is equated to a sin in the novel because the bird only offers beauty and does no harm, paralleling the way the book disapproves of the unjust treatment of innocent people caused by discrimination and lack of knowledge.
