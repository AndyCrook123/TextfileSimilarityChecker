Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' features the mockingbird as a symbol of pure innocence. The book argues that just as there is a deep wrongdoing in killing a mockingbird, which only offers beauty and poses no harm, there is equal wrongdoing in the destruction of innocent lives by way of prejudice and a lack of understanding.
