In the classic novel by Harper Lee, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', the titular metaphor of the mockingbird stands for the untainted and pure. The book equates the act of killing a mockingbird, which only exists to provide joy and poses no threat, to an egregious sin. It casts a critical eye on the act of harming the innocent, who suffer due to societal prejudices and ignorance.
