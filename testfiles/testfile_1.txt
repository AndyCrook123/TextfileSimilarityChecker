Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' metaphorically presents the mockingbird as an embodiment of innocence and purity. The narrative underscores that harming a mockingbird, which epitomizes beauty and harmlessness, is akin to a sin. Similarly, the story criticizes the grave injustice of harming innocents due to bias and unawareness.
