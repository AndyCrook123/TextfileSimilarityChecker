In Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 
the title symbolizes the innocence and purity represented by the mockingbird. 
Just as it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, which only brings beauty and harmlessness, 
the novel condemns the moral wrongdoing of destroying innocent beings through prejudice and ignorance.
