In 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Harper Lee illustrates that the mockingbird is a symbol of purity and innocence. The novel portrays the act of killing a mockingbird as a sin, because these birds only contribute beauty and are harmless, condemning the moral evil of harming the guiltless who suffer from prejudice and a lack of knowledge.
